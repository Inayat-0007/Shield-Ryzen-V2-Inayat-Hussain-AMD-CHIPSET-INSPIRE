# 📦 Shield-Ryzen V2: Complete Transfer Guide

**Mission:** Move 100% of this project (Code + Models + Environment) from one Google Antigravity account (or machine) to another.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Push Everything (Already Done)
We have already pushed **100%** of your project (including the big model files) to your new GitHub repository.

**Repository:** `https://github.com/Inayat-0007/Shield-Ryzen-V2-Inayat-Hussain-AMD-CHIPSET-INSPIRE.git`

This acts as your "Safe House".

---

## 📥 Step 2: "One-Command" Setup on New Account/Machine

On your **NEW** Antigravity account (or new machine), simply paste these commands into the chat or terminal:

### A. Clone the Repository (0 to 100%)
```bash
# 1. Download the full project
git clone https://github.com/Inayat-0007/Shield-Ryzen-V2-Inayat-Hussain-AMD-CHIPSET-INSPIRE.git

# 2. Enter the folder
cd Shield-Ryzen-V2-Inayat-Hussain-AMD-CHIPSET-INSPIRE
```

### B. Pull Large Files (The Models)
*Note: GitHub stores large files as pointers. You need this step to actually download the 80MB model.*
```bash
# Only if Git LFS is installed (Standard on most dev machines)
git lfs pull
```
*(If `git lfs` command not found, just proceed. If models are missing, download `ffpp_c23.pth` manually from the repo).*

### C. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### D. Run!
```bash
python live_webcam_demo.py
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting the Transfer

**Q: "Model file not found" or "size is 1KB"?**
*   **Cause:** You didn't run `git lfs pull`.
*   **Fix:** Run `git lfs install` then `git lfs pull`.
*   **Manual Fix:** Go to the GitHub repo -> `ffpp_c23.pth` -> Click "Download" -> Put it in the folder.

**Q: "Missing modules (cv2, mediapipe)"?**
*   **Fix:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

## 🔒 Security Note
This transfer method relies on a **PUBLIC** repository (based on the URL provided).
*   **Warning:** Anyone can see your code.
*   **Fix:** If you want privacy, go to GitHub Settings -> Danger Zone -> Change visibility to **Private**.
